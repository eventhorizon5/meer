    # "health" checks are a set of signatures that are triggered every so 
    # often to ensure a sensor is up and operational.  When these events
    # are triggered,  they are not stored into the database as normal alert
    # data.  For example,  with MySQL/MariaDB output enabled, they update the 
    # "sensor.health" table with the current epoch time.  Think of these
    # events like a "ping" for your sensor.  This can be useful for detecting
    # when Meer, Suricata or Sagan have "died" unexpectedly.
